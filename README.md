# Dark Patterns in the Wild

### Introduction
The term "dark patterns" belongs to the field of UX design. 
It describes any design that involves manipulation or coercion of the design's user [1]. 
These patterns have been extensively studied among academics, industry specialists, and policy-makers. 
Dark patterns are notably problematic due to their exploitation of cognitive biases, often to meet some ulterior motive of the designer [4]. 
Many analyses of dark patterns lean heavily on manual coding and qualitative analysis [2][5][6]. 
Some research attempts to analyze dark patterns at scale across thousands of websites [3]. 

### Description
My project attempts to combine at-scale data scraping with small-scale manual coding. 
I built a web scraper to collect data en masse from Reddit, namely the community '/r/assholedesign'. 
Then, I performed a manual coding of the data. 
Finally, I passed the coded data into a basic analyzer to get bar graphs. 

This project was conducted as part of WWS 356: Civil Liberties in the Digital Age. 
I took this course during my Spring 2020 semester at Princeton University, with Professor Ari Waldman. 
I wrote a term paper about dark patterns, using the results from this code.
